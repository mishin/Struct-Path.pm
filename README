Struct-Path

Path lib for nested structures where path is also a structure

There are two main reasosns why such wheel as Path reinvented again:
1.  Because of existed libs use bare strings as items indicators,
    it's possible for collisions to occur. Example: '/a/0/c' may be path
    for both {a => [{c => x}]} and {a => {0 => {c => x}}}.
2.  There is no module on CPAN (at least I failed to find such) which
    use perl structure for a path (useful, for example, in JSON conf files,
    in inter process communications, etc).

INSTALLATION
